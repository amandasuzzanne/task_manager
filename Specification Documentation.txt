1.	Project Background and Description
One of the elements that affects the success of a task is its ability to be completed and maintained on schedule. Therefore, it is crucial to make sure that there are appropriate deadlines to be observed in order to:
•	Ensure the task is done on time;
•	Aid in quick reporting;
•	Track the tasks.

2.	Project Scope
A responsive web-based application system will be used in the project, and it will be accessible online via laptops and desktop computers.

3.	High-Level Requirements

The following elements must be present in the system:
•	Creation of user accounts;
•	Authentication and authorization of users during login;
•	Addition of tasks details;
•	Availability of both the new and the old task data; 
•	Event calendar for the tasks;
•	Summary report of tasks.

4.	Deliverables
•	Front-end and back-end application.
•	User interface prototypes.
•	Accessible responsive online application for members.

5.	Affected Parties
•	Application Users

6.	Specific Exclusion from Scope
The following will not be included in this initial phase but rather will be included in later phases: -
•	A direct email connection that enables automatic real-time email reminders to users of approaching deadlines.
•	Integration with any existing systems.
